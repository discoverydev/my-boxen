# Discovery Boxen

This is a customized Boxen project for configuring a Discovery development environment.

## Prerequisite

This is intended to configure Discovery Dev and Infrastructure machines on OSX hardware only.

## Getting Started

To give you a brief overview, we're going to:

* Install dependencies (basically Xcode)
* Pull down customized Boxen
* Run Boxen to configure environment

### Dependencies

Install the full Xcode and Command Line Tools.**

## What You Get

List of packages installed, intentially not listed.  Please check the [site.pp](https://github.com/discoverydev/my-boxen/blob/ads/manifests/site.pp) file to find the current list of packages installed:

### Setup
#### Create local OSX user
create local OSX user (jenkins) as Administrator, please use username: 'jenkins' and password: 'password'

#### Setup Boxen on local machine
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
sudo chown admin:staff /opt/boxen
git clone https://github.com/discoverydev/my-boxen /opt/boxen/repo
cd /opt/boxen/repo
git checkout ads
./script/boxen
```

It should run successfully, and should tell you to source a shell script
in your environment.
For users without a bash or zsh config or a `~/.profile` file,
Boxen will create a shim for you that will work correctly.
If you do have a `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, your shell will not use
`~/.profile` so you'll need to add a line like so at _the end of your config_:

``` sh
[ -f /opt/boxen/env.sh ] && source /opt/boxen/env.sh
```

Once your shell is ready, open a new tab/window in your Terminal
and you should be able to successfully run `boxen --env`.
If that runs cleanly, you're in good shape.

* execute the init script (need to talk about where zip file will reside)
